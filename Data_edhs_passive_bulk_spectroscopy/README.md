# EDHS passive bulk spectroscopy (operator-level) — frozen artifacts

This folder is a **frozen artefact pack** for a numerical note on passive operator-level spectroscopy of a trace-defined Einstein–Dilaton background.

## Contents

- `edhs_passive_bulk_spectroscopy_preprint.pdf` — the preprint PDF.
- `figures/` — frozen figures referenced by the PDF (S1–S7).
- `artifacts/` — supplementary JSON datasets referenced by the PDF.
- Zenodo DOI (this version): [10.5281/zenodo.18063497](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18063497)

## Notes

- Only **observables and frozen outputs** are included here (plots + JSON). No internal repository paths, command lines, or solver implementation details are included.
- The datasets are intended to support independent inspection (e.g., reproducing plots from the provided JSON), not to distribute the underlying kernel/solver.
